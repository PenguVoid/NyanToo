This is my first take at ebuilds and a way for me to store and update some ebuilds

If you wanna add my repo for whatever reason:
> layman -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PenguVoid/NyanToo/master/repository.xml -f -a NyanToo

Currently in here:

`net-im/discord-canary`
`games-misc/minecraft-launcher`
`www-client/firefox`

(The firefox ebuild is a copy of the official gentoo one and is modified to compile with clang and llvm v10)
