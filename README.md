This is my first take at ebuilds and a way for me to store and update some ebuilds

If you wanna add my repo for whatever reason:
> layman -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PenguVoid/NyanToo/master/repository.xml -f -a NyanToo

Currently in here:

`net-im/discord-canary` `games-misc/minecraft-launcher` `www-client/firefox` `net-vpn/logmein-hamachi`
(The firefox ebuild is a copy of the official gentoo one and is modified to compile with clang and llvm v10)

Versions:

`Firefox 69.0.1` `Discord Canary 0.0.96` `Hamachi 2.1.0.203`
